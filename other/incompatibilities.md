# Incompatibilities

## Unsupported Server Software

The following server software will not receive support. Although the plugin may work, it is prone to issues and deviates from the mechanics of Spigot/Paper.

* **CraftBukkit** - Action bar will not work
* **Modded hybrid servers \(Mohist, Magma, CatServer\)** - Modded environments do not work well with Bukkit plugins in general
* **Minehut** - Minehut servers have an error that makes commands not work. This is a Minehut issue that I can't fix.

## Incompatible Server Modes

* **Offline Mode** - We do not support piracy in any way, and player data saving may not work.

## Incompatible Plugins

* **LoreAttributesRecoded** - Will reset health when doing certain actions. Can be fixed by disabling the health in that plugin.
